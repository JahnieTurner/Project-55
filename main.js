One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate its successful defense against Demetrius Poliorcetes, who had besieged it for a year with a large army and navy. According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high — approximately the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown — making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In accordance with a certain oracle, the Rhodians did not build it again. John Malalas wrote that Hadrian in his reign reerected the Colossus, but he was wrong. According to Suda, the Rhodians were called Colossaeans (Κολοσσαεῖς), because they erected the statue on the island.");
